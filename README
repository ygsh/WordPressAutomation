- To test Appium, update the "siteurl" in wp_option table in wordpress table to an IP so you can access 
it over the local wifi. For example, I changed the siteurl to "http://192.168.1.8".

- On the app, the url is "hosted url" and written as http://192.168.1.8/xmlrpc.php

- Ensure you always remove the URL and re-add it whenever you do this change.

- The update above can be done from UI as well by going to settings and changing wordpress url.

- Once this is done, server tests cannot be done as server is running on local machine and it causes
from within this machine you obviously cannot access from outside IP.

- To test server, simply change this url back to locahost.

- Actually if the URL update is done from the backend, both the server and the app works locally.
